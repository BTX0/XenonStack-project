## 4. CONTACT US 

A Contact Us page isn't just another page on your website. In fact, it is one of your most valuable pagesâ€”and should be treated as such. A contact page provides guidance for existing customers and offers an overview of your brand for new visitors. But contact pages aren't always crafted with care.

here we have 4 field name , Email, subject and message and one button for send the message and also we store all the information in database.
